# Dynamic Webpage with JavaScript #

Websites are made up of three layers.
1. Content- Where the content of the page was = HTML
2. Presentation- Enhances the HTML with notes that state how the HTML looks = CSS
3. Behavior- This is where we can change how the page behaves and adds interactivity = JavaScript

**Remember: Keep HTML, CSS, and Javascript separate.**

When the browser comes across a *<script>* element, it stops to load the JavaScript and checks to see if it needs to do something. Where the < script> is located, the Javascript is loaded and changes the way users interact with the page.

**Statement-** A scripts a series of instructions that a computer can follow. Each direction or step is a statement. Statements should end in a semicolon(;) Each Statement should start on a new line and stops in a semicolon (;), and it tells JavaScript when a step is over. Statements can be organized into Code blocks {}, which are not followed by a semicolon.

#### Example of a Statement: ####
var today = newDate ();

#### Remember: JavaScript is case sensitive, so "hello" and "Hello" are different. ####

***Always write comments in your code to explain what your system does. Comments make your code easier to read and understand to others who read it.***

**Multi-line Comments**
```
/* Hello, I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment hello I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment. Hello, I am a comment. */

Single-line Comments

//Hello, I am a comment.

```

#### What is a variable? ####
*A script will have to temporarily store bits of info it needs to do its job. It can store data in variables*

#### How to declare a variable? ####
*To use a variable, you must create one and give it a name. Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what you want to store for you. Until you have assigned a variable a value, it is undefined.*

***Ex. var quantity. The variable keyword is var, and quantity is the name.

***Once you have created a var, you don't need to keep using var; use the variable name.***

***If a variable name is more then one word, you must write it in camelCase.***

They are three data types.
1. Numeric – numbers, -1, .25, 13,234 etc. 
2. String – handles characters and A-Z @ # ! etc 
3. Boolean – one of two values. True or false, 0 or 1, etc.
